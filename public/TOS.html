                            </ul>
                            <p>Each pricing model shall be referred to as a "Charge Event".</p>
                            
                            <p>An Advertiser shall also set the price for the Advertising Material (the "Price"). The charge shall be calculated having regard to the applicable Charge Event and Price.</p>
                            
                            <p>For example, if an Advertiser has opted for CPM and has set the price at $1.00, the Advertiser shall be charged a fee of $1.00 for every 1,000 impressions.</p>

                            <p><strong>6.3.</strong> By using the Services you agree to pay the relevant Charges.

You shall be able to view the number of impressions/clicks/actions via your Dashboard.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>6.4.</strong> Upon completion of a Charge Event, you agree that the applicable Charge shall be automatically deducted from your Available Balance.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Post-Pay</h3>
                            
                            <p><strong>6.5.</strong> Adsvertiser may, in its sole and absolute discretion, offer you post-payment terms within your Account. The following sub-clauses of this clause 6 shall apply to those Advertisers who are on Post-Pay terms.</p>

                            <p><strong>6.7.</strong> Adsvertiser shall invoice you on a monthly basis for the charges provided within the billing period in accordance with Clauses 6.5 and 6.6, unless otherwise specified in the Additional Payment Terms. Payment shall be made to the account stated on the invoice. Time for payment is of the essence.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>6.8.</strong> The Advertiser shall pay all amounts stated in invoices in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding (except for any deduction or withholding required by law). If any such withholding or deduction is required, the Advertiser shall, when making the payment to which the withholding or deduction relates, pay to Adsvertiser such additional amount as will ensure that Adsvertiser receives the same total amount that it would have received if no such withholding or deduction had been required. Adsvertiser may at any time, without limiting any other rights or remedies it may have, set off any amount owed to it by the Advertiser against any amount payable by Adsvertiser to the Advertiser.</p>
